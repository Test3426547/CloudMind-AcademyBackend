Auto (best for prompt)

Depending on their size, subject, and complexity, your prompts will be sent to Llama 3 70B Instruct, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (self-moderated) or GPT-4o.  To see which model was used, visit Activity.  A major redesign of this router is coming soon. Stay tuned on Discord for updates.
